# week1 
## 1.1 - Why program? 
 - And the idea is that the computer itself at the lowest level in the hardware is just not that smart.

 - But it has a lot of flexibility in that if we give it the right instructions, it can do amazing things. If we give it right instructions to listen to voice, digitize the voice, then you can write a program that can "hear"

## 1.2 -  Hardware overveiw

- The central Process Unit is very simple, it's the closest thing computers have to brains, but it wants to answer the question what to do next, but we have to feed, through memory.

- The answers which is your programs. And then we have input devices, output devices, the main memory.

*just sneak peek for python code

```python
x = 'fruit'
letter = x[1]#we call this 'letter = x sub 1(Bracket)'
print(letter)
```
