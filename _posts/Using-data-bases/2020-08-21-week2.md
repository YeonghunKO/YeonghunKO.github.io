# 1. Week 2

## TABLE 이란?

![relation](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/relation.png){:class="img-fluid"}

- And so this notion of modelling stuff at a connection is the underlying math that makes databases fast, but when we programmers think about it, we kind of think about it as rows and columns.


![columns](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/columns.png){:class="img-fluid"}

- 그냥 쉽게 말해서 table 이라고 생각하면 된다. 그리고 table 상단에 metadata를 지정해주면 끝! 이런식으로 데이터를 관리한다.

You just kind of come up with a data model, a schema, a strategy so that you know that the first colums is always the title, the second column is the rating, because if you didn't lable it, it would make no sense. So we often do something where the first row of spreadsheet is kind of metadata about the columns, right? Now the spreadsheet doesn't exactly know that you're doint it.

## SQL

![sql](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/sql.png){:class="img-fluid"}

- So here's our database, and it has lots of complexity in it. And orginally, we sort of just talked straight to that complexity, but after a while we would have a database application. And then our application, our code, would talk to the database app. And the data would know all the magic stuff. And it was what we call in computer science an abstraction(backend?), which means that our job was easier because the complexity could all be hidden here. 
- And so the question becomes, then how do we talk to this really powerful piece of software that we call a database? What is living here? What is the way we communicate ? Sometimes we would call this an API, Application Program Interface. 
- We can sort of think of this thing right here, both the data and the software(DB) that understands the shape of the data, as just a service in a service oriented architecture. 

- So what happened was, we decided to create a standart at this point. The folks got together with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, and they agreed on a language that was the API between an application and a database system. And the name of that thing they came up with was SQL, or the Structured Query Language, okay? 

- Python cleans up the data. SQL is a great way to store and retrieve data.

## TABLE 만들기

![table](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/table.png){:class="img-fluid"}

- So this is CREATE TABLE named Users, and we're going to put two columns into it, and one is of variable length character, up to 128 characters, an email that's also a variable length chracater up to 128 characters. So this is sort of our schema, this is our contract. We can't put a thing called age in the table, we can't put a thing called favorite beverage in the table and we can't put 129 characters in the name column.



![insert](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/insert.png){:class="img-fluid"}

- 이제 sqlite로 데이터를 정리해보도록 하자. 데이터 덩어리가 있다. 내가 파이썬을 사용하여 sqlite에 명령을 하고 sqlite가 그 덩어리를 정리하는 것이다. 이때 sqlite가 알아들을 수 있는 언어를 SQL이라고 정했다. SQL을 사용해서 파이썬이 sqlite에 명령을 내리는 것이다.

- Now what we were just doing in that user interface was exactly this. Here is another example of some SQL where INSERT INTO is kind of like a  single keyword. The name of the table, a paranthesized list of the columns and then the word VALUES, that's just part of SQL, and then a paranthesized list of the corresponding values. And so that is a SQL statement that inserts a new record into our Users table. 


## Create table and write it into database using python

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect("C:\\Bitnami\\wampstack-7.4.6-1\\apache2\\htdocs\\emaildb.sqlite") # Mention the full path to where SQLite is located.
cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Counts') # place cursor and write commands as if you are in the SQLite.

cur.execute('''
CREATE TABLE Counts (email TEXT, count INTEGER)''') # Counts 라는 테이블을 만들고 meta data를 email, count로 한다음 각각의 값을 text, integer로 지정했다.

fname = input('Enter file name: ')
if (len(fname) < 1): fname = 'mbox-short.txt'
fh = open('Coursera python/' + fname)
for line in fh:
    if not line.startswith('From: '): continue
    pieces = line.split()
    email = pieces[1]
    cur.execute('SELECT count FROM Counts WHERE email = ?', (email,)) # 커서를 counts 테이블에 email에 둔다. 
    row = cur.fetchone()
    if row is None:
         cur.execute('''INSERT INTO Counts (email, count)
                  VALUES (?,1)''', (email,)) # 기존의 이메일이 없으면 텍스트 파일에서 찾은 이메일을 email 란에다가 새로 추가하고 count 를 한다.
    else:
        cur.execute('UPDATE Counts SET count = count + 1 WHERE email = ?', 
                     (email,)) # 기존에 email이 있으면 count를 하나씩 추가.
    conn.commit()

# http://www.sqlite.org/lang_select.html
sqlstr = 'SELECT email, count FROM Counts ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10' # count 순으로 했을때 top 10을 뽑는거다.

for row in cur.execute(sqlstr):
    print(str(row[0]),row[1]) # 첫번째가 이메일, 두번째가 count가 되는거다

cur.close()

```

- It's not as simple as you just open it and read it, but you open it and then you send SQL commands through the cursor and then you get your responses through that same cursor. Basically, what we're doing here is we're really going to pretend that this is a dictionary. The first thing we're going to do is we're going to select count from our database, that is an integer where email equals. And this part right here bears some explaning.(if email is found, question mark is going to be replaced by the email.) So 

- this is actually not really reading the data.  But we have prepared this cursor. This is kind of like the opening of a file but what we're opening is a record set. That is , if there are no records that meets this, then row is going to be null. So if row is None, we're going to run an insert statement, insert into Counts email, count. (if statement)
	 
- So there's only one question here. One question mark placeholder here and then 1 is the initial count so email, question to questionmark, count to 1, away we go and so then again we have a tuple that gives to this exectue statement, just like in that exectue statement, the corresponding sort of strings or integers that are to be placed by each of the question.(if statement - cur.execute command)

- So if the row exists, we just know that it exists and we just want to add one to the number. (update command)
	
- And this conn.commit, basically the way it works it that the database is efficiently keeping some of the information in memeory and at some point, has to write all that stuff out to disk.

- So let's take a look as what's in the database and now we can actually read the database and so, in the database, we're going to run a select and we're going to select the email account from counts order by count descending(sqlstr). 

- So look at that, isn't it cool? We're getting in the top ten because databases are good at sorting.

- So we're going to then execute this and then we're going to ask for the rows one at a time and the rows are going to be a tuple and row sub zero will be email and row sub one will be count.(for row in cur.execute)
