# 1. Week 1

![ter](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/ter.png){:class="img-fluid"}

- Here are the ones that list of the list objects, and that means the objects of type list. And list data type has methods. Methods are these things that are functions built into objects. 

- What would be the equivalent US floor? Thank heaven I have this application, right? And so there is this notion of kind of  like inside and outside where we hide the detail. 


![object](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/obeject.png){:class="img-fluid"}

- And the program itself kind of orchestrates these objects, one or more objects working together


- And the best way to think about an object, it's kind of like a program but smaller. It's a little thing that we can draw a boundary around and say, there's some code and data in there. 



![method](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/method.png){:class="img-fluid"}

object(객체)는 이미 그 자체로 프로그램이다. 안에 복잡한 코드들이 집약되어있다. 그리고 그 객체가 가진 기능들을 method 라고 한다. `list.append()` 라고 했을때 list 객체는 append 라는 method 를 실행할 수 있다. 

- And that is things like string.upper() /  string.find() etc. those are all methods in the string class. But they also are part of every string object.



![party1](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/party1.png){:class="img-fluid"}

- And as i mentioned, every class has some data associated with the class , and some code associated with the class. And so here in this class, we just have some variables, x=0. That's an attribute of, all PartyAnimals will all have a variable named x in them. So this is now a method, so it has a bit of code, it's method. But what happens then is, we have a template called PartyAnimal. And this syntax here, that basically says make me a PartyAnimal, it's the same as saying x =list()
-    So that's what's happening here, mint me a new PartyAnimal, based on the template that's up here. And then once that empty, or fresh, PartyAnimal is done, then give it to me back in the variable 'an'. Using the PartyAnimal template makes a PartyAnimal object , which ends up in the variable an. 
-  And then we make a call by taking the name of the object dot, dot is the operator. 
	


![party2](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/party2.png){:class="img-fluid"}

우리가 임시로 object를 만들수 있다. partyanimal 이라는 객체를 만들고 그 안에 또 코드를 정의하였다. 객체 안에 있는 코드는 method 라고 보면 된다. 따라서 `partyanimal.party()` 라고 하면 partyanimal 안에 있는 party() method 를 실행하라는 뜻이다.

- So If we trace through the code that's going to happen here. And then this whole object, this whole box is the object because it has a variable, an attribute x, and a bit of code called party(). And then we take this, It gets returened, and then it comes back as an. And so an sort of points at this particular object, when this line of code is done. So temporarily , self is also pointing to this. 


![inde](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/inde.png){:class="img-fluid"}

이렇게 객체안에 method 를 넣고 다른 parameter를 넣은다음 각각 다르게 변수를 지정하여 다르게 불러올 수 도 있다.

- So these are two x's, two names, but they're sort of independently stored in each of those objects. And so these are two independent instances, the key here is instances. And that's because we minted or caused to be constructed two Party Animals and then had them in seperate variables. And so simulataneously, each one of them has all the internal structure that they need.


![obj](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/obj.png){:class="img-fluid"}

또는 두개의 객체를 합칠 수 있다. 바로 이전의 객체를 parameter로 쓰면 된다. 그럼 parameter로 쓴 객체의 method를 사용할 수 있으면서 지금 객체의 method도 사용할 수 있게 된다.

- We have a constrcutor, and the whole idea of the constructor is just to grab that name parameter. So now we say class Footballfan and in parantheses here, we have the name of a different class. So what we're saying is Partyanimal, Footballfan is everything that Partyanimal is plus whatever we define down here. 

- It's as if all this(partyanimal object) was pulled in, and then this is addition, okay? So a football fan has an x instance variable, a name instance variable, and a points instance variable. It's like it came in by us saying, the way I read this in English is "class FootballFan extends PartyAnimal"

- And then we can make a new object using the FootballFan template. SO and give it a name, and that FootballFan actually calls, there is no constructor here and so it's actually calling this constructor, the one from PartyAnimal. Because Partyanimal is included in FootballFan. But then we also have now a touchdown method that can run this code, okay? And so you can see that this FootballFan has every capability that the PartyAnimal has, plus one more capability that we've added.

용어정리

- An object or an instance is that we construct from the template. So class is the cookie cutter and object is the cookie. And a constructor is a bit of code that runs at the moment of object creation, and inheritance is the ability to define a new class and add the existing capabilites of an existing class to make that class.
