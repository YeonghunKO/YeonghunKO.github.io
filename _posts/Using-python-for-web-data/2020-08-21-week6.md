# 1. Week 6


![json](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/json.png){:class="img-fluid"}

json은 xml 과 달리 더 많은 정보를 담고 있지는 않지만 간결하여 배우기 더 쉽다. 

- This loads stands for load from string. It parses and converts from the JSON syntax into a python in this case list.

- And so what happens is that this JSON is not as rich a representation as XML, but because it's simple and it maps directly onto the internal structures that we have in all these language. It's a lot easier to use.




![json2](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/json2.png){:class="img-fluid"}

json은 정보를 위계가 있는 리스트, 그리고 dict로 나타낸다.

- Item is going to iterate through those two things, which it's going to iterate through here and then it's going to iterate through that. This is going to be a dictionary and this one as well. So loop's going to run twice, once with this as item, which is dictionary, and the next time with that as item as a dictionary. 



![service](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/service.png){:class="img-fluid"}

서로다른 어플이 정보를 주고 받을때 service layer 통해서 정보를 자동으로 공통 포맷형태로 바꿔 주고 받는다. 

- So if you're booking hotels from an airline site, the airline gets a little kickback(사례금) for bringing a customer to the hotel. Because the hotels want customers and if the airline brings hotels, but then there's this service, and then somebody has to, the airline company person has to write some code that reads the data from the car rental company, and back and forth, and so everyone has to figure all this stuff out.
	 And we talk abou these things in the form of APIs, Application Programming Interfaces, which are ways to use web protocols to access data on systems, using well-defined and structured approaches.
	
	
- By applying a service layer to the applications you wish to connect up, data is offered up in a common format for reuse elsewhere. The service-oriented approach works with existing software systems and does not require you to remove the monolithic application. 
	 Replacement applications reuse the links already made and can plug into the service layer without affecting other users of the data. New applications can be added to grow overall system architectures in the same way.



![world](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/world.png){:class="img-fluid"}

- When the service-oriented apporach is evolved into a system-wide architecture , it allows connections and service sharing opportunities between organizations nationally and globally.



![location](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/location.png){:class="img-fluid"}

구글 맵스에 들어가서 장소를 하나하나 다 입력한 다음에 그 장소에 해당하는 위도,경도,장소이름을 정보형태로 제공해준다.  
사람손으로 하면 진짜 귀찮은 일을 컴퓨터가 다 알아서 처리해주는 것이다. 파이썬을 이용해서.

- And so it has this url as a string and then it's going to read and ask for a location with an input. And then the address is what we type right here, so that goes into the string address. We make it so if we hit Enter by itself, it breaks, then we're going to make a URL by concatenating this URL. This urlencode address equals address, that's the thing that turns this into the plus and this into the %2C ,and this into the comma right? 


- Remember , the handle('uh') doesn't actually pull the data from. But if i call the ,ead method, uh.read(), that does pull the entire document, all that text from that previous page, curly braces , square braces etc. And remember that we have to decode it, because it's probably UTF-8 out there. So we probably are going to hit Google and they're going to give us UTF-8 data back. 

- And here we now have this loads, json loads, which parses that data we got back from Google. We're getting back an object. So the outer thing with curly braces is object. So that means it's a python dictionary that we end up getting.

- And then what i'm going to do is i'm going to walk my way down the tree. And so it's got a dictionary, js sub results, and then it's got a list , sub 0 , which is the first result and then that is dictionary. And then i want to go geometry, location, and then latitude. So that's sort of walking down the tree.


```python
import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error # url 에 들어가 정보를 빼내는 module
import json
import ssl

api_key = False
# If you have a Google Places API key, enter it here
# api_key = 'AIzaSy___IDByT70'
# https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro

if api_key is False:
    api_key = 42
    serviceurl = 'http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/json?'
else :
    serviceurl = 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?'

# Ignore SSL certificate errors
ctx = ssl.create_default_context()
ctx.check_hostname = False
ctx.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE

while True:
    address = input('Enter location: ')
    if len(address) < 1: break

    parms = dict()
    parms['address'] = address
    if api_key is not False: parms['key'] = api_key
    url = serviceurl + urllib.parse.urlencode(parms) #api 를 이용해 구글 맵스 url 에 자동 접속 

    print('Retrieving', url)
    uh = urllib.request.urlopen(url, context=ctx)
    data = uh.read().decode()
    print('Retrieved', len(data), 'characters')

    try:
        js = json.loads(data) # 구글 맵스에서 해독한 정보를 json 형태로 로딩함.
    except:
        js = None

    if not js or 'status' not in js or js['status'] != 'OK':
        print('==== Failure To Retrieve ====') # json에 꼭 있어야 할 것들이 있지않으면 이 메시지가 뜨도록 함.
        print(data)
        continue

    print(json.dumps(js, indent=4)) # 4 정도로 들여쓰기 하라는 뜻.

    lat = js['results'][0]['geometry']['location']['lat'] # result안에서 첫 위계에 해당하는 가지를 쭉 내려가다가 geometry 안에 location 안에 lat의 값을 원한다는 의미. 밑에 첨부한 코드처럼 구글맵스 정보가 json 형태로 되어있다.
    lng = js['results'][0]['geometry']['location']['lng']
    print('lat', lat, 'lng', lng)
    location = js['results'][0]['formatted_address']
    print(location)

```
```bash
...
