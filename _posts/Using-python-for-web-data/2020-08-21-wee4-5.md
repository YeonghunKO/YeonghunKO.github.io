# 1. Week 4

![unicode](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/unicode.png){:class="img-fluid"}

	
- So after all that, think of it his way. Before we send it, we have to encode it, and then we send it. Getting stuff back, we recieve it , it comes back as bytes. We happen to know it's UTF-8 or we're letting it automatically detect UTF-8 and decode it and now we have a string.  
- And now internally inside of Python we can write files, we can do all kinds of stuff in and out of stuff and it sort of works all together.

![soup](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/soup.png){:class="img-fluid"}

				
- And what happnes is , in this soup variable, it's somehow taken all the nasty bits that come from the web page and cleaned them up, and made a little pretty tree of things.

- And  you can ask soup some questions at that point. So it takes the nasty HTML and cleans it up. That's what this parsing is doing.

앞에서 배운 마찬가지로 밖에서 정보를 끌어올때는 socket을 매게로 해서 끌어오고 recv() 라는 함수를 사용한다. 그리고 utf 언어의 형태로 받아들여 해독한다. 정보를 보낼때는 반대의 과정을 거친다.  

beautiful soup 라는 모듈이 있는데, 밖에서 불러들인 정보안에 불필요한 문자, 빈칸을 삭제한뒤 다듬어서 전송해주는 기능을 가지고 있다. 

# 2. Week 5

![net](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/net.png){:class="img-fluid"}

- The network is a data, i mean it's data that's going to go across. And so we have worked out, over the years, what we call the Wire Protocol, or how the data leaves one system, transits a network, and then enters another system. And in that destination system, it's not always Python. And so perhaps, our Python dictionary in this other system needs to be a Java HashMap. So we take our internal structure, serialize it, send it across the network, then we receive it.

- We de-serialize it, and then we use it in this other programming language, in whatever structure makes sense, in that particualr programming language.
	
- And XML is kind of like the older of the two, and JSON is the more modern of the two. It is two types of serialization.



![xml](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/xml.png){:class="img-fluid"}

- And so the primary purpose of XML is to share structured data. It was a simplified subset of this SGML, which kind of was precursor to both XML and HTML. 

서로다른 두개의 언어가 인터넷을 통해 정보를 주고 받을때 xml 이라는 언어를 사용한다.

![xml2](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/xml2.png){:class="img-fluid"}

- There is always the outer tag. We see a series of attributes Right? So the attributes are key equals and then double=quoted stirng, key equals double=quoted string . We can create all kinds of structures that are really designed based on the needs of our working two applications that are trying to cooperate.

xml의 모습인데 글의 주요 속성이 attribute이다. <recipe> 안에 담겨진 정보를 뜻한다. 

![schema](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/schema.png){:class="img-fluid"}

- And so XML validation is the act of taking an document and a Schema Contract, which itself is also an XML document, and then sending to the Validator. This XML matches that contract and that's the idea. 

- So this bit here validates everywhere. we can check and validate that every one of the tags there meets the needs of this XML schmea.



![parsing](https://yeonghunko.github.io/assets/img/coursera-python/parsing.png){:class="img-fluid"}

- And that says 'go find me the attribute named "hide" within the tagged email and so that then gives us back yes.



xml 언어로 쓰여진 데이터를 임시로 만들어서 그 데이터에서 정보를 선별적으로 찾아내는 과정이다.
